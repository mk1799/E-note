# E-note

This is my first web application project developed as project in second year of computer engineering.


## How It Works?

### It is a platform for students and teachers at any instituition.

### Teachers put thier important notices and announcement on this web app and students can view them. Moreover teacher can also put resources like study material or schedules for events or exams and students can download file from there.
